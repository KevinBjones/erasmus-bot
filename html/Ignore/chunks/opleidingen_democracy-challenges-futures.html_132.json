    "content": "We put maximum effort into blended education , a combination of online classes and classes on campus. This way, students don't necessarily have to be on campus if they don't need to, but we also believe in the added value of physical teaching moments. Usually classes are taught for a few hours spread over one semester or one academic year. If there is mandatory attendance for a particular course, it will be clearly communicated in advance. You can always view the class schedules for the current academic year. In the class schedule you can find out whether a course is online, on-campus or via lecture recordings. If a course does not appear in the timetable, it can be followed via recordings. The best way to view the schedule is on a course-by-course basis. That way you can estimate whether it can be combined.",
