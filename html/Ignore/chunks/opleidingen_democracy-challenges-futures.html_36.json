    "content": "The future of democracy Democracy has never been more celebrated and under threat at the same time. It has been heralded as the best way of making political decisions, but it is also vulnerable to many challenges, chief among which are citizen dissatisfaction, policy short-termism, polarization and misinformation. That is why it is crucial for current and future decisionmakers , and engaged citizens alike, to critically assess the main challenges to democracy, and to acquire the foresight tools necessary for improving democratic governance futures. This micro-credential meets both goals. On the one hand, it offers its participants a thorough theoretical and empirical overview of the main challenges to democracy. On the other hand, it also crucially aims to foster students\u2019 future-thinking skills to inform how governance could look like in near and long-term. Even though the micro-credential is taught at an advanced level, it is open to a wide variety of audiences, ranging from policy-makers at all levels of government (local, regional, national or European) to citizens concerned with the current state of democracy. The courses are organised in an interactive way including working sessions in which we let you experience the various techniques in a hands-on-manner, complemented with lectures that can be followed online or in class. The courses are therefore suitable for anyone with a professional or personal interest in the state of democracy.",
